      <p> My love of natural skincare came from issues I had with my own skin, from my teenage years. I had started to chemically process my hair and hadn't taken enough care to ensure that the solution didn't touch my scalp. This resulted in me developing psoriasis that started on my scalp and eventually spread to different parts of my body.</p>

      <p>After using over the counter ointments, shampoos and steroid creams I realised that there were really only a temporary fix, some of which damaged my skin in other ways whilst using it. </p>
        
        <p>I remember at one point not having access to anything other than coconut oil to soothe my itchy skin and scalp so I used it out of desperation and noticed that not only did it reduce my symptoms a bit but also made my skin feel supple and nourished. Not like the likes of the other prescribed and over the counter products did, and that's when my curiosity peaked about using natural ingredients.</p>
