        <h2>Why make your own?</h2>

      <p> Because why not?! The benefits of having completely natural skincare are endless, there are many unseen nasties in conventional cosmetics which can cause all sorts of irritations. But making your own body butter from scratch ensures that you know exactly what is going into it and that the ingredients are all natural. you can make your own in three easy steps! </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>So how do you do it?</h2>

        <h4> Step one </h4>
          <p> Gather your ingredients but first... Butters! Any type of butter you like. There are hundreds of choices, but the most popular ones are Cocoa butter and Shea butter. They make excellent bases for body butter due to their light but rich moisturising properties.

            You can have more than one butter in your mix... but just one of these is enough to get you started. A particularly nice mix that I like to use is, Shea butter, Aloe butter and Avocado butter. The latter two give the mix a beautiful velvety texture which helps it glide onto your skin.

            You will also need an oil to go into your mix, which one you use is completely upto you but again the most popular ones to use are light oils such as Sweet almond oil, Coconut oil and Jojoba oil. I would also recommend a Vitamin E oil for it's restorative properties. </p>

      <div class="card">
    <h4> Step two </h4>
          </p> Heat up your butters in a glass or metal mixing bowl with the double boiling method. If you're not sure what this is, it's simply placing a bowl on top of a pot of boiling water to heat your ingredients. Put around two inches of water in your pot and bring it to the boil then chop up your butter into chunks, so the heat distributes more easily. Then place the butter into the glass or metal bowl and place it over the boiling water. Gently stir around the butters until it's all melted and then remove it off the pot and let it cool. You want it to cool until it starts to set slightly on the top.</div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Step three </h4>
            <p> Next you'll need to add in your oils. These are an ingredient to compliment the butters, so of course you won't want to add too much in, around two tablespoons per 500g of butter. If you add too much it can end up feeling too greasy and become heavy. Then use a hand mixer, a mixing machine or an electri whisk to whip the butter up. After around two minutes, you should notice your mixture turning thick and eventually into a lovely meringue type consistency. Once it get to the point where the ripples from the whisk stay in tact, that's when you know your butter is ready to use! Happy days!</p></div>
